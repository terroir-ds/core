# Task: Extract All Tasks from Backup

<!-- AUTO-MANAGED: Do not edit below this line -->
**After Completion**: merge to develop
**Next Action**: continue to task 003
<!-- END AUTO-MANAGED -->

## Objective

Thoroughly review ALL files in the backup directory (`.claude-backup-20250630-045811/tasks/`) and extract ALL valuable task ideas, ensuring no work is lost. This includes ~80 files across multiple subdirectories, not just the 22 specifications.

**CRITICAL**: Each backup file may:

- Create one or more NEW tasks (possibly for different agents)
- Update one or more EXISTING tasks with additional details
- Contain overlapping ideas that need to be consolidated
- Be irrelevant (but still needs review to confirm)

**When processing files, you MUST**:

1. Read the ENTIRE file from backup
2. Identify ALL relevant tasks it relates to (new or existing)
3. For existing tasks: Compare content to ensure ALL information is preserved
4. Create new tasks OR update existing ones as needed
5. Handle overlapping ideas by consolidating into the most appropriate task
6. Only mark as REVIEWED after confirming all valuable content is extracted

This is a methodical process - prioritize completeness over speed. One backup file may impact multiple tasks.

## File Tracking Process

### Naming Convention

When a file has been FULLY reviewed and its content extracted:

- Rename: `original-name.md` → `REVIEWED-original-name.md`
- Only rename AFTER confirming ALL relevant tasks have been created
- Do NOT delete any files during this process

### Review Process

1. **One file at a time** - Focus on complete extraction before moving on
2. **Identify all impacts** - One file may affect multiple tasks across agents
3. **For existing tasks** - ALWAYS compare full content to ensure nothing is missing
4. **Handle overlaps** - When content appears in multiple files, consolidate in the most appropriate task
5. **Verify completeness** - Check that all subtasks, details, examples, and sections are captured
6. **Create/Update task files** - Ensure proper numbering and auto-managed sections
7. **Update this file** - Add progress after EACH file is processed
8. **Mark as reviewed** - Rename the source file with REVIEWED- prefix ONLY after verification
9. **Never rush** - It's better to be thorough than fast

### Overlap Resolution

When the same idea appears in multiple files:

- Choose the most detailed version as the primary source
- Merge unique details from other sources
- Note in the task which backup files contributed to it
- Avoid duplication across tasks

### Benefits

- Clear visibility across context windows
- No lost information
- Easy to resume from any point
- Can verify extraction quality later

## Extraction Plan

### Full Scope (~80 files total)

The backup contains multiple directories with valuable content:

```text
.claude-backup-20250630-045811/tasks/
├── specifications/       # 22 detailed spec files
├── active/              # Sprint plans and active work
│   └── sprint-1/        # Agent-specific tasks
├── completed/           # Finished work with follow-ups
├── backlog/            # Future work items
└── [other files]       # Various planning documents
```

### 1. Specifications Directory (22 files)

- Detailed technical specifications
- Each may create multiple tasks or update existing ones
- Extract ALL subtasks, implementation details, and examples

### 2. Active/Sprint-1 Directory

- Agent-specific task breakdowns
- Sprint planning documents
- Work-in-progress items that need continuation

### 3. Sprint Planning Documents

- sprint-1-plan-v2.md (detailed 5-pass breakdowns)
- comprehensive-improvements.md (multiple improvement ideas)
- revised-sprint-1-tasks.md (documentation tasks)
- infrastructure-immediate-tasks.md

### 4. Completed Work

- Check for partially completed tasks
- Extract refactoring opportunities noted
- Identify future work mentioned

### 5. Backlog Items

- Ensure all are properly categorized
- May contain hidden gems of ideas

### 6. Root Level Files

- Planning documents
- Architecture decisions
- Cross-cutting concerns

- **Tasks Remaining**: ~53  
- **Completion**: 35%

### Latest Additions

- Agent 2: 006-008, 010-020 (Coverage, dependencies, tooling, optimization)
- Agent 3: 005-020 (Core component library)
- Agent 0: 016-022 (AI docs, patterns, integration)

### Current Agent Task Distribution

- **Agent 0**: 21 tasks (Integration & Planning)
  - 001-003: Task reorganization, extraction, .claude improvements
  - 010-015: Quality gates, CI/CD, security framework
  - 020, 022-027: Memory system, API contracts, prompt updates, 5-pass guide, standards, conflict prevention, process improvements
  
- **Agent 1**: 17 tasks (Utilities)
  - 001-003: String, case, security utilities
  - 004-007: Decomposed string utilities (truncate, template, indent, wrap)
  - 008-015: Type guards, environment, performance, timing, data transform, testing, error patterns, stack trace
  - 016-017: Implementation tracker, testing strategy
  
- **Agent 2**: 17 tasks (Infrastructure)

### Summary

- Created detailed, implementation-ready tasks
- Properly decomposed large specifications
- Maintained agent domain boundaries
- All tasks have auto-managed metadata

## Key Findings

1. **String utilities need decomposition**: The specification shows 6 separate modules, not just 1-2 tasks
2. **Missing infrastructure tasks**: Many important setup tasks weren't migrated
3. **Component roadmap incomplete**: Need full component library plan
4. **Cross-cutting concerns**: Some tasks span agents and need coordination

## Next Steps

1. Create all these task files with proper detail
2. Run `pnpm tasks:update` to set auto-managed sections
3. Review priorities and adjust numbering if needed
4. Archive this extraction task once complete
