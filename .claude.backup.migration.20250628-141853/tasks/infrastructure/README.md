# Infrastructure Task Management

This directory contains all planning and tracking for infrastructure development in the Terroir Core Design System.

## Overview

We're building enterprise-grade infrastructure to support a world-class design system. This includes everything from security scanning to multi-tenancy support, organized into 14 implementation waves over 6-12 months.

## Current Status (June 2025)

- âœ… **Foundation Complete**: Logging, validation, testing, linting
- ðŸš§ **Wave 0 Active**: Error patterns and type systems
- ðŸ“‹ **Waves 1-14 Planned**: Security through future platform features

- **Future (Waves 13-14)**: 2-3 engineers

### Estimated Costs
- **Infrastructure**: $2,200-5,000/month
- **Tools**: $27,000/year
- **Total First Year**: ~$50,000-90,000

## How to Contribute

1. **Check Roadmap**: Find your wave in roadmap.md
2. **Read Guide**: Follow implementation-guide.md
3. **Update Status**: Track progress in this README
4. **Document Changes**: Update relevant docs

## Risk Management

### High Priority Risks
1. **Performance regression** â†’ Automated benchmarking
2. **Security vulnerabilities** â†’ Continuous scanning
3. **Breaking changes** â†’ Versioning strategy

### Mitigation Strategy
- Automate everything possible
- Measure continuously
- Document thoroughly
- Test extensively

## Next Actions

1. Complete error handling patterns (Wave 0)
2. Set up security scanning (Wave 1)
3. Configure Renovate/Dependabot (Wave 1)
4. Generate API documentation (Wave 2)
