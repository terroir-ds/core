# Immediate Infrastructure Tasks (Next 30 Days)

## Overview

These are the highest priority infrastructure tasks that should be completed within the next 30 days. They address critical gaps, security concerns, and foundational needs.

## Week 1: Critical Security & Quality

### 1. Security Scanning Setup ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**Why**: No current vulnerability scanning
**What**:
- [ ] Run initial `npm audit` and fix issues
- [ ] Set up Snyk GitHub integration
- [ ] Configure security policies
- [ ] Document security procedures

**Success Criteria**: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities

### 2. Error Handling Standardization ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**Why**: Inconsistent error patterns across codebase
**What**:
- [ ] Create standard error base classes
- [ ] Define error code system
- [ ] Implement error serialization
- [ ] Update existing error usage

**Success Criteria**: All errors follow standard pattern

### 3. Type Guard Completion ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**Why**: Started but not finished, blocking other work
**What**:
- [ ] Complete guard implementations
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
- [ ] Integrate into error system
- [ ] Update TypeScript settings

**Success Criteria**: 100% test coverage, all guards working

## Week 2: Documentation & Automation

### 4. API Documentation Generation ðŸ”¥ HIGH
**Why**: No automated API docs for public release
**What**:
- [ ] Configure TypeDoc
- [ ] Set up GitHub Pages deployment
- [ ] Document all public APIs
- [ ] Create usage examples

**Success Criteria**: Auto-generated docs on every commit

### 5. Dependency Automation ðŸ”¥ HIGH
**Why**: Manual dependency updates are risky
**What**:
- [ ] Configure Renovate
- [ ] Set update schedules
- [ ] Define merge policies
- [ ] Test automation flow

**Success Criteria**: Automated PRs for all updates

### 6. CHANGELOG Automation ðŸ”¥ HIGH
**Why**: Manual changelogs are error-prone
**What**:
- [ ] Set up conventional commits
- [ ] Configure semantic-release
- [ ] Generate per-package changelogs
- [ ] Update contribution guide

**Success Criteria**: Automated changelog on release

## Week 3: Performance & Monitoring

### 7. Bundle Size Tracking ðŸ”¥ HIGH
**Why**: No visibility into package sizes
**What**:
- [ ] Set up bundlesize checks
- [ ] Configure size limits
- [ ] Add to CI pipeline
- [ ] Create size dashboard

**Success Criteria**: Failing builds on size regression

### 8. Performance Budgets ðŸŽ¯ MEDIUM
**Why**: Need baselines before optimization
**What**:
- [ ] Define performance metrics
- [ ] Set up measurement tools
- [ ] Establish budgets
- [ ] Create monitoring alerts

**Success Criteria**: Automated performance tracking

### 9. Build Time Optimization ðŸŽ¯ MEDIUM
**Why**: Builds getting slower as we grow
**What**:
- [ ] Profile current build
- [ ] Implement caching
- [ ] Optimize TypeScript config
- [ ] Parallelize tasks

**Success Criteria**: <30 second full builds

## Week 4: Developer Experience

### 10. VSCode Workspace Setup ðŸŽ¯ MEDIUM
**Why**: Inconsistent developer environments
**What**:
- [ ] Create .vscode settings
- [ ] Add recommended extensions
- [ ] Configure debugging
- [ ] Document setup

**Success Criteria**: Consistent dev experience

### 11. Development Container ðŸŽ¯ MEDIUM
**Why**: "Works on my machine" issues
**What**:
- [ ] Create Dockerfile
- [ ] Configure devcontainer.json
- [ ] Add development tools
- [ ] Test on multiple platforms

**Success Criteria**: One-click dev environment

### 12. Quick Start Guide ðŸŽ¯ MEDIUM
**Why**: Onboarding is too complex
**What**:
- [ ] Create 5-minute quickstart
- [ ] Add interactive examples
- [ ] Include troubleshooting
- [ ] Get user feedback

**Success Criteria**: New devs contributing in <10 min

## Quick Wins (Do Immediately)

### Security Quick Fixes
```bash
# Run these NOW
npm audit fix
npm update
```

### Documentation Gaps
- [ ] Add README to packages/core
- [ ] Document environment variables
- [ ] Create architecture diagram
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines

### Configuration Cleanup
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate configs
- [ ] Update .gitignore
- [ ] Clean up scripts
