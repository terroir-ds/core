## Sprint History

### Sprint 001: Foundation (2025-06-26 to 2025-07-02)
- **Focus**: Basic functionality across all domains
- **Pattern**: 5-pass development (Work → Right → Safe → Tested → Documented)
- **Agents**: 4 parallel development tracks

### Sprint 002: Features (Planned)
- **Focus**: Advanced features building on foundation
- **Pattern**: TICK sprint - new functionality

### Sprint 003: Refactoring (Planned)
- **Focus**: Apply standards discovered in Sprint 1-2
- **Pattern**: TOCK sprint - optimization and standardization

## Pattern Library

Patterns are extracted from completed work and stored for reuse:

1. **[Error Handling](./patterns/error-handling.md)** - Typed errors with context
2. **[Test Structure](./patterns/test-structure.md)** - Co-located test organization
3. **[API Design](./patterns/api-design.md)** - Consistent function signatures

## How to Use

### Adding Completed Work
1. Run `.claude/scripts/complete-sprint.sh [sprint-number]`
2. Review generated summary
3. Extract notable patterns
4. Commit to version control

### Finding Patterns
```bash
# Search for specific patterns
grep -r "pattern-name" .completed/patterns/

# List all patterns
ls .completed/patterns/
````

## Metrics

Track project velocity and quality:

- Lines of code per sprint
- Test coverage trends
- Pattern reuse frequency
- Time to completion
