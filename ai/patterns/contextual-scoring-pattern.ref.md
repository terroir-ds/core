# Contextual Scoring Pattern References

## Task Usage (WHEN)

- 2025-07-01: task-001-five-pass-development-guide - Created to resolve scoring mismatch for documentation standards
  - Pattern Score: 5/5 (Exemplary pattern)
  - Scoring breakdown:
    - Clarity: 5/5 - Crystal clear contextual interpretations
    - Completeness: 5/5 - Covers all major artifact types
    - Context: 5/5 - Excellent problem explanation
    - Outcomes: 5/5 - Solves the noun/verb/adjective alignment
    - Teachability: 5/5 - Great examples for each context
  - Hash: current
  - Notes: Resolves the complexity of multiple rubrics while maintaining consistency

### To Be Applied

- Update standard-quality-scoring pattern to reference this
- Re-score index-file-convention using contextual interpretation
- Apply to future non-code standards

## Insights

- Universal criteria with contextual interpretation is simpler than multiple rubrics
- "Validation" cleverly maps to tests (code), examples (docs), or metrics (process)
- Maintains ability to compare across artifact types
- Reduces cognitive load - learn once, apply everywhere

## Audit Notes

- [ ] Update existing scoring references to use contextual interpretation
- [ ] Document this in the scoring standard
- [ ] Create quick reference card for interpretations
- [ ] Add to phase transition guidance
