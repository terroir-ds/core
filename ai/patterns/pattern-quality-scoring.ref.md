# Pattern Quality Scoring Pattern References

## Task Usage (WHEN)

- 2025-07-01: task-001-five-pass-development-guide - Created initial pattern during Phase 2 system documentation
  - Pattern Score: 5/5 (Exemplary pattern instance)
  - Scoring breakdown (using pattern-quality-scoring):
    - Clarity: 5/5 - Crystal clear scoring structure and rubric
    - Completeness: 5/5 - Covers all aspects including automation rules
    - Context: 5/5 - Excellent problem/solution explanation
    - Outcomes: 5/5 - Measurable quality improvement for docs
    - Teachability: 5/5 - Perfect as training material
  - Hash: current
  - Notes: First meta-pattern, sets foundation for quality control

- 2025-07-01: task-001-five-pass-development-guide - Applied to score standard-quality-scoring pattern
  - Pattern Score: 5/5 (Exemplary application)
  - Scoring breakdown (using pattern-quality-scoring):
    - Clarity: 5/5 - Clear demonstration of scoring process

## Implementation Locations (WHERE)
<!-- To be populated when pattern is implemented in code -->
### Planned Implementations

- `scripts/score-example.js` - CLI tool for scoring examples
- `scripts/update-references.js` - Auto-update logic using scores
- `.github/workflows/update-docs.yml` - CI/CD integration

## Insights

- First meta-pattern: a pattern about managing patterns
- Enables self-maintaining documentation system
- Critical for long-term sustainability of AI-first docs

## Audit Notes

- [ ] Create scoring CLI tool
- [ ] Integrate with phase transition workflow
- [ ] Add to git hooks for automatic scoring prompts
- [ ] Build automation for example selection
