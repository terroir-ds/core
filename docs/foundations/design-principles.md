# Design Principles

These fundamental principles guide every decision in Terroir Core, from token architecture to component design.

## Core Principles

### 1. Accessibility First

Every design decision prioritizes inclusive access. We believe great design works for everyone.

**What This Means:**
- Every color combination tested for WCAG compliance
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure throughout
- Screen reader optimization built-in

**Why It Matters:**
Accessibility isn't an add-on or afterthoughtâ€”it's the foundation of good design. When we design for the most restrictive constraints, we create better experiences for everyone.

### 2. Performance Focused

Optimize for speed without sacrificing functionality. Fast experiences feel better and reach more users.

**What This Means:**
- Build-time token resolution (zero runtime overhead)
- Tree-shakable architecture
- Optimized asset delivery
- Progressive enhancement approach

**Why It Matters:**
Performance is a feature. Slow experiences exclude users on slower devices and networks, making performance an accessibility concern.

### 3. Developer Experience

Make the right thing the easy thing. When tools are intuitive, teams build better products.

**What This Means:**
- TypeScript definitions for everything
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clear error messages
- Automated quality checks

**Why It Matters:**
Developer experience directly impacts user experience. Happy developers build better products, and good tooling prevents bugs before they reach users.

### 4. Scientific Approach

Base decisions on research and data, not trends. Leverage proven principles from human-computer interaction and visual perception.

**What This Means:**
- Material Color Utilities for perceptually uniform color generation
- Evidence-based accessibility guidelines
- Performance budgets based on real user metrics
- Usability testing to validate design decisions

**Why It Matters:**
Design trends come and go, but human perception and cognition remain constant. By building on scientific foundations, we create systems that stand the test of time.

## Application in Practice

### Token Design
- **Accessibility First**: Every token validated for contrast and legibility
- **Performance**: Build-time generation eliminates runtime calculations
- **Developer Experience**: Semantic naming that matches mental models
- **Scientific**: Based on Material Design's research into color perception

### Component Architecture
- **Accessibility First**: ARIA patterns and keyboard navigation built-in
- **Performance**: Minimal DOM overhead and efficient rendering
- **Developer Experience**: Consistent APIs and comprehensive TypeScript support
- **Scientific**: Based on established interaction design patterns

### Documentation Strategy
- **Accessibility First**: Clear hierarchy and screen reader optimization
- **Performance**: Fast search and lightweight pages
- **Developer Experience**: Progressive disclosure and contextual help
- **Scientific**: Information architecture based on user research

## Measuring Success

We validate these principles through:

- **Automated accessibility testing** (axe-core, lighthouse)
- **Performance monitoring** (Core Web Vitals, bundle analysis)
- **Developer satisfaction surveys** and contribution metrics
- **A/B testing** of documentation and component APIs
