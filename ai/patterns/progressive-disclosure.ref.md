## Manual References

### Already Applied

- Multi-pass development method structure
- Pattern/standard reference system
- Phase-specific guides
- Task file organization

### Planned Applications

- Component documentation
- API reference structure
- Tutorial organization

## Insights

- Context conservation is critical for AI efficiency
- Reference-based loading mirrors how developers navigate docs
- 50-70% savings enables much larger codebases
- Progressive loading matches human cognitive patterns

## Audit Notes

- [ ] Measure actual context savings in practice
- [ ] Create loading strategy for different agent types
- [ ] Build reference resolution tooling
- [ ] Document anti-patterns (what not to load)
