# Security Hardening Implemented in v3.4.0

This document summarizes the security enhancements implemented in version 3.4.0 of `setup-git-ssh.sh`.

## Overview

Version 3.4.0 adds comprehensive security hardening based on a thorough security review. The enhancements focus on preventing common attack vectors while maintaining usability and backward compatibility.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Signal Handling and Cleanup Registry

**Purpose**: Ensure sensitive files are cleaned up even if the script is interrupted.

**Implementation**:

- Added signal traps for INT, TERM signals
- Created `CLEANUP_FILES` and `CLEANUP_DIRS` arrays to track resources
- `cleanup_on_exit()` function called on all exit paths
- Sensitive variables cleared on exit

**Code Location**: Lines 254-313

### 2. SSH Agent Socket Validation

**Purpose**: Prevent attacks through malicious socket files.

**Implementation**:

- `validate_ssh_agent_socket()` function checks:
  - File exists and is actually a socket (`-S`)
  - Socket is not world-writable
  - Socket is owned by current user
- Invalid sockets trigger new agent creation

**Code Location**: Lines 1388-1414

### 3. Enhanced Process Name Validation

**Purpose**: Prevent process injection attacks where malicious programs masquerade as ssh-agent.

**Implementation**:

- Changed from substring matching to exact binary name matching
- Uses `basename` to strip path components
- Only accepts exact match of "ssh-agent"

**Code Location**: Lines 1539-1543

### 4. Improved Username Sanitization

**Purpose**: Prevent injection attacks through malicious username values.

**Implementation**:

- `get_safe_username()` function with:
  - Length limit (32 characters)
  - Character whitelist (alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen)
  - POSIX compliance (must start with letter/underscore)
  - Fallback to "unknown" if sanitization fails

**Code Location**: Lines 207-230

### 5. Signal Masking During Critical Operations

**Purpose**: Prevent corruption or exposure of sensitive data during SSH key operations.

**Implementation**:

- `mask_signals()` blocks INT, TERM, HUP during critical sections
- `unmask_signals()` restores normal signal handling
- Applied during SSH key addition to agent

**Code Location**: Lines 1737-1746, 1841-1900

### 6. Network Error Message Sanitization

**Purpose**: Prevent information leakage about internal network topology.

**Implementation**:

- Removed specific IP addresses and hostnames from error messages
- Generic messages like "Network connectivity issue detected"
- Detailed diagnostics only in debug mode

**Code Location**: Lines 903-908

### 7. Audit Logging

**Purpose**: Track security-relevant events for forensics and monitoring.

**Implementation**:

- `audit_log()` function for security events
- Logs to both standard log and optional audit file
- Tracks events like:
  - SSH agent reuse
  - SSH key additions
- Includes timestamp and caller information

**Code Location**: Lines 364-378

### 8. Existing Security Features Enhanced

The script already had many security features that were enhanced:

- **File Permission Validation**: Warns about overly permissive .env files
- **Resource Limits**:
  - Max 1MB .env file size
  - Max 1000 lines per .env file
  - Max 50 SSH keys to load
- **Input Validation**:
  - Email format validation with length limits
  - SSH key format and size validation
  - JSON validation with size limits
- **Secure File Operations**:
  - Uses `shred` for secure deletion
  - Atomic file writes
  - Temporary files created with 600 permissions

## Security Benefits

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection
2. **Fail Secure**: Script fails safely on security errors
3. **Minimal Attack Surface**: Validates all external inputs
4. **Audit Trail**: Security events are logged
5. **Resource Protection**: Prevents DoS through resource limits

## Backward Compatibility

All security enhancements maintain backward compatibility:

- Same command-line interface
- Same environment variables
- Same output format
- Same functionality

## Testing

The enhanced script has been tested for:

- Normal operation with valid credentials
- Invalid SSH socket handling
- Network error scenarios
- Signal interruption handling
- Resource limit enforcement

## Future Enhancements

Some advanced security features were considered but not implemented to maintain simplicity:

- TOCTOU prevention with file descriptors
- Adaptive network timeouts
- Script integrity checking
- Command allowlisting
- Canary tokens for breach detection

These remain documented in `setup-git-ssh-security-recommendations.md` for potential future implementation.

## Conclusion

Version 3.4.0 significantly improves the security posture of the setup-git-ssh.sh script while maintaining its ease of use and reliability. The implemented measures provide comprehensive protection against common attack vectors.
