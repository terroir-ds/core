## Migration Notes for Users

Users who set up the old system should:
1. Remove old workspace files (*.code-workspace)
2. Ensure all agent branches have feat/initial-setup merged
3. Re-run host-setup.sh to get the latest configuration
4. Open agent folders directly instead of using workspace files

## Future Documentation Tasks

1. Consider creating a CHANGELOG.md for multi-agent system updates
2. Add performance tuning guide for running 3 containers
3. Create troubleshooting videos or GIFs for common issues
4. Document backup/recovery procedures for agent work
