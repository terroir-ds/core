# Standard Quality Scoring Pattern References

## Task Usage (WHEN)
- 2025-07-01: task-001-five-pass-development-guide - Created during Phase 2 system documentation
  - Pattern Score: 5/5 (Exemplary pattern instance)
  - Scoring breakdown:
    - Clarity: 5/5 - Crystal clear implementation
    - Completeness: 5/5 - Comprehensive with all edge cases
    - Context: 5/5 - Rich context with rationale
    - Outcomes: 5/5 - Clear benefits and use cases
    - Teachability: 5/5 - Excellent examples and rubric
  - Hash: current
  - Notes: Complements pattern-quality-scoring perfectly

## Implementation Locations (WHERE)
<!-- To be populated when pattern is implemented in code -->
### Planned Implementations
- `scripts/score-standard.js` - CLI tool for scoring standard implementations
- `scripts/audit-standards.js` - Bulk standard compliance checking
