# Phase 2: Review & Polish (20%)

## Objective
Quick review to ensure clarity and add any missing examples.

- [ ] "When to Use" has concrete scenarios
- [ ] At least one working example
- [ ] Common issues documented
- [ ] Related docs linked
```

### 2. Test Examples
```bash
# Quick validation
- Copy and run each command/code block
- Fix any that don't work
- Add output examples if helpful
```

### 3. Polish Pass
```markdown
## Quick improvements:
- Add a second example if time permits
- Clarify any confusing steps

# Optional metadata (if helpful)
*Created: YYYY-MM-DD | Complexity: Low/Medium/High | Time: X-Y min*
```

## Ship It
Documentation doesn't need to be perfect to be useful. If it answers:
- What is this?
- When do I use it?
- How do I do it?
- What's an example?

Then it's ready to ship. You can always iterate later.
