# Methodical File Processing Pattern References

## Task Usage (WHEN)

- 2025-07-01: task-001-five-pass-development-guide - Documented from previous work
  - Pattern Score: 4/5 (Good pattern instance)
  - Scoring breakdown (using pattern-quality-scoring):
    - Clarity: 4/5 - Clear implementation with good examples
    - Completeness: 4/5 - Covers core approach, could add error recovery
    - Context: 4/5 - Good use cases identified
    - Outcomes: 4/5 - Benefits clear, could quantify more
    - Teachability: 5/5 - Very practical with template
  - Hash: current
  - Notes: Practical pattern for bulk operations

### Potential Applications

- Migration scripts for file reorganization
- Bulk asset processing pipelines
- Pattern extraction across codebase
- Documentation generation scripts

## Insights

- Renaming approach provides visual progress in file system
- Resumability is critical for long-running operations
- Progress tracking prevents duplicate processing
- Could be enhanced with parallel processing support

## Audit Notes

- [ ] Add error recovery examples
- [ ] Include parallel processing variant
- [ ] Add checkpointing for very large sets
- [ ] Create reusable script template
